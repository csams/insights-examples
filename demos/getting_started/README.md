# Getting Started
Insights core is an inversion of control framework for expressing dependencies
between classes or functions.

These examples start by showing how to use insights-core as a simple dependency
framework. Then they introduce a few conventions that allow you to make use of
other built-in features.

Start in the rules directory and then come back here.

Once you have a directory full of rules, you can run them with the following:
`python3.6 -m insights -p rules`. Alternatively, `driver.py` shows how to run
them from within an application.
