# Getting Started
These examples start by showing how to use insights-core as a dependency
framework. They then introduce a few basic features you can layer on top of
that.

Start in the rules directory and then come back here.

Once you have a directory full of rules, you can run them with the following:
`python3.6 -m insights -p rules`. Alternatively, `driver.py` shows how to run
them from within an application.
